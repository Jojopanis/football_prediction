This a quick readme that we still need to flesh out

## Usage

Don't. Airflow is a real pain.

## Contributors

[Alper](https://github.com/carpanalper) the real goat, got airflow running in docker with all the good folders at the right place.\
[Antoine](https://github.com/antoineservais1307) spent way too much time on tweaking the ML model, but ended up with a really cool result.\
[Ridvan](https://github.com/gkridvan) went for another approach on the ML thing, so we got 2 good models running together for differents types of predictions.\
[Geoffroy](https://github.com/Jojopanis) tried to do a good database, and implemented the automated addition to it.

## Timeline

 We were off to a good start, scrapper was set up, db was kinda working, models were training, until came the time to setup airflow. The data engineers struggled for 2-3 days to find a good, and clean, way to make it run. Once that was done, the analysts were done with their streamlit and models, so we wrapped up the project.
